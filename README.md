# convert_video_to_images
This code assumes that the video file to be converted is passed as a command line argument when the script is run. For example, to convert a video file named "video.mp4" using this script, the command would be:
```
python convert_video_to_images.py video.mp4

```
The script will create a new directory with the current date and time as the name, and save each frame of the video as an image file in that directory. The file names will be the frame numbers.
